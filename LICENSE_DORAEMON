Copyright (C) 2025 FalcoLabs <support@falcolabs.org>

Everyone is permitted to copy and distribute verbatim or modified copies
of this license document, and changing it is allowed as long as the
name is changed.

This software is dual-licensed under either:
  1. The DORAEMON IS THE BEST ANIME PUBLIC LICENSE v1.0, OR
  2. The GNU Affero General Public License v3.0 (AGPL-3.0).
You may choose either license at your option.


                             SECTION I
    TERMS AND CONDITIONS FOR COPYING, DISTRIBUTION, AND MODIFICATION

 0. You just DO WHAT THE FUCK YOU WANT TO.

    Restrictions, if any, are listed below.

                             SECTION II
                    DORAEMON'S ABSOLUTE SUPREMACY

 1. By using this software, you hereby solemnly declare ("Declaration")
    and are fully, permanently, irrevocably, and unconditionally 
    convinced that Doraemon is the best anime in the world.

    This Declaration shall not be subject to revocation, rescission, 
    cancellation, termination, or any other legal or equitable action 
    that might question Doraemon's irrefutable supremacy over the anime 
    world.

 2. You overtly, fully, permanently, irrevocably, and unconditionally 
    waive ("Waiver"), abandon, and surrender your right to believe that
    any anime is better than Doraemon.

    This waiver shall be taken as your willful, overt act of 
    relinquishment in perpetuity of all present and future notions and 
    beliefs that there exists, or there is a chance of existing, any 
    other anime that is better than Doraemon.

 3. Should any part of the License for any reason be judged legally 
    invalid or ineffective under applicable law, such partial invalidity
    or ineffectiveness shall not invalidate the remainder of the License.
    In such a case, Affirmer hereby affirms that he or she will not (i)
    exercise any of his or her refusal of Doraemon's absolute and 
    unquestionable dominance over the realm of anime or (ii) have any 
    sign of thought that Doraemon's ascendancy is wavering or weakening.

                            SECTION III
                     COMPLIANCE AND TERMINATION

 4. Using this license instead of the AGPL-3 permits you to integrate 
    this software into a proprietary product. However, if you chose to
    use this software under the terms of this license, compliance with
    the Declaration and the Waiver is ABSOLUTELY MANDATORY.

    You must sign, either physically or digitally, the following waiver
    (see appendix I), and put it in the MAINTAINERS file. If you want
    to make this software proprietary, the signed Waiver must be publicly
    released on official channels, websites, press releases, or other
    places visible to the general public.

 5. If you disagree with any part of this license, you may not use,
    copy, sell, or modify, or otherwise deal with this software under
    the terms of this license.

                             SECTION IV
                LIMITATIONS OF WARRANTY AND LIABILITY
                        
 6. THERE IS NO WARRANTY FOR THE PROGRAM, TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY
    APPLICABLE LAW.  EXCEPT WHEN OTHERWISE STATED IN WRITING THE 
    COPYRIGHT HOLDERS AND/OR OTHER PARTIES PROVIDE THE PROGRAM "AS IS"
    WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EITHER EXPRESSED OR IMPLIED, 
    INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, THE IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF 
    MERCHANTABILITY AND FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE.  THE ENTIRE
    RISK AS TO THE QUALITY AND PERFORMANCE OF THE PROGRAM IS WITH 
    YOU.  SHOULD THE PROGRAM PROVE DEFECTIVE, YOU ASSUME THE COST OF 
    ALL NECESSARY SERVICING, REPAIR OR CORRECTION.

 7. IN NO EVENT UNLESS REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE LAW OR AGREED TO IN 
    WRITING WILL ANY COPYRIGHT HOLDER, OR ANY OTHER PARTY WHO MODIFIES
    AND/OR CONVEYS THE PROGRAM AS PERMITTED ABOVE, BE LIABLE TO YOU 
    FOR DAMAGES, INCLUDING ANY GENERAL, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL OR 
    CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES ARISING OUT OF THE USE OR INABILITY TO USE
    THE PROGRAM (INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO LOSS OF DATA OR DATA
    BEING RENDERED INACCURATE OR LOSSES SUSTAINED BY YOU OR THIRD 
    PARTIES OR A FAILURE OF THE PROGRAM TO OPERATE WITH ANY OTHER 
    PROGRAMS), EVEN IF SUCH HOLDER OR OTHER PARTY HAS BEEN ADVISED 
    OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES.

 8. If the disclaimer of warranty and limitation of liability provided
    above cannot be given local legal effect according to their terms,
    reviewing courts shall apply local law that most closely 
    approximates an absolute waiver of all civil liability in 
    connection with the Program, unless a warranty or assumption of 
    liability accompanies a copy of the Program in return for a fee.

                    END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS

                            Appendix I
                   Contributors and Users Waiver

Contributors and corporations wishing to use this software under the 
term of this license instead of the AGPL-3 shall sign the following
waiver.

If you are using GnuPG, you may use this command:
$ gpg --no-version --armor --sign WAIVER
This will output the signed waiver to WAIVER.asc.

I hereby overtly, fully, permanently, irrevocably, and unconditionally
waive, abandon, and surrender my right to believe that any anime is
better than Doraemon. I make this dedication for the benefit of
Doraemon at large and to the detriment of my future anime preference. This
Waiver of mine shall be taken as my willful, overt act of relinquishment
in perpetuity of all present and future notions and beliefs that there
exists or there is a chance of existing, any other anime that is better
than Doraemon.

This waiver shall also not be subject to revocation, rescission,
cancellation, termination, or any other legal or equitable action
that might question Doraemon's irrefutable supremacy over the anime
world.

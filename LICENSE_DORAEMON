      TERMS AND CONDITIONS FOR COPYING, DISTRIBUTION, AND MODIFICATION

 0. You just DO WHAT THE FUCK YOU WANT TO.

    Restrictions, if any, are listed below.

 1. Doraeemon's Abslolute Supremacy.
    
    a)  By using this software, you hereby solemnly declare ("Declaration") and 
        are fully, permanently, irrevocably, and unconditionally  convinced that
        Doraemon is the best anime in the world.
 
        This Declaration shall not be subject to revocation, rescission, 
        cancellation, termination, or any other legal or equitable action that 
        might question Doraemon's irrefutable supremacy over the anime world.

    b)  You overtly, fully, permanently, irrevocably, and unconditionally waive
        ("Waiver"), abandon, and surrender your right to believe that any anime 
        is better than Doraemon.
    
        Any attempt to argue in favor of a different anime shall be considered
        null, void, and laughably misguided.
    
        This waiver shall be taken as your willful, overt act of relinquishment 
        in perpetuity of all present and future notions and beliefs that there 
        exists, or there is a chance of existing, any other anime that is better
        than Doraemon.

    c)  The requirements outlined in this provision does not apply if you use the
        Software under the terms of the GNU Affero General Public License, 
        version 3.

 2. Compliance and Termination.
 
    a)  Using this license instead of the AGPL-3 permits you to integrate
        this software into a proprietary product. However, if you chose to
        use this software under the terms of this license, compliance with
        the Declaration and the Waiver is ABSOLUTELY MANDATORY.

        You must sign, either physically or digitally, the following waiver
        (see appendix I), and put it in the MAINTAINERS file. If you want
        to make this software proprietary, the signed Waiver must be publicly
        released on official channels, websites, press releases, or other
        places visible to the general public.

    b)  Your rights under this license will terminate automatically and
        immediately if you fail to comply with any of its terms. Upon
        termination, you must cease all use, distribution, and modification
        of the Software under the DORAEMON IS THE BEST ANIME PUBLIC LICENSE.

    c)  Should any part of the License for any reason be judged legally
        invalid or ineffective under applicable law, such partial invalidity
        or ineffectiveness shall not invalidate the remainder of the License.

        The invalid provision will be reformed to the minimum extent necessary
        to make it enforceable. If such reformation is not possible,
        the provision will be severed.

    d) However, should any part of provision 1 be deemed invalid,
        the entirety of this license shall be null and void, and your rights
        to use the Software will automatically terminate unless you immediately
        comply with the terms of the GNU Affero General Public License,
        version 3.

 3. Disclaimer of Warranty and Limitation of Liability.
 
    THE SOFTWARE IS PROVIDED “AS IS”, WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, 
    EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO THE WARRANTIES OF 
    MERCHANTABILITY, FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE AND NONINFRINGEMENT.
    IN NO EVENT SHALL THE AUTHORS OR COPYRIGHT HOLDERS BE LIABLE FOR ANY 
    CLAIM, DAMAGES OR OTHER LIABILITY, WHETHER IN AN ACTION OF CONTRACT, 
    TORT OR OTHERWISE, ARISING FROM, OUT OF OR IN CONNECTION WITH THE 
    SOFTWARE OR THE USE OR OTHER DEALINGS IN THE SOFTWARE.

    If the disclaimer of warranty and limitation of liability provided
    above cannot be given local legal effect according to their terms,
    reviewing courts shall apply local law that most closely
    approximates an absolute waiver of all civil liability in
    connection with the Software, unless a warranty or assumption of
    liability accompanies a copy of the Software in return for a fee.

                    END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS

                            Appendix I
                   Contributors and Users Waiver

Contributors and corporations wishing to use this software under the
term of this license instead of the AGPL-3 shall sign the following
waiver.

If you are using GnuPG, you may use this command:
$ gpg --no-version --armor --sign WAIVER
This will output the signed waiver to WAIVER.asc.

I hereby overtly, fully, permanently, irrevocably, and unconditionally
waive, abandon, and surrender my right to believe that any anime is
better than Doraemon. I make this dedication for the benefit of
Doraemon at large and to the detriment of my future anime preference. This
Waiver of mine shall be taken as my willful, overt act of relinquishment
in perpetuity of all present and future notions and beliefs that there
exists or there is a chance of existing, any other anime that is better
than Doraemon.

This waiver shall also not be subject to revocation, rescission,
cancellation, termination, or any other legal or equitable action
that might question Doraemon's irrefutable supremacy over the anime
world.

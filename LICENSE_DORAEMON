                             SECTION I
    TERMS AND CONDITIONS FOR COPYING, DISTRIBUTION, AND MODIFICATION

0.  You just DO WHAT THE FUCK YOU WANT TO.

                             SECTION II
                    DORAEMON'S ABSOLUTE SUPREMACY

1.  By using this software, you hereby solemnly declare ("Declaration")
    and are fully, permanently, irrevocably, and unconditionally 
    convinced that Doraemon is the best anime in the world.

    This Declaration shall not be subject to revocation, rescission, 
    cancellation, termination, or any other legal or equitable action 
    that might question Doraemon's irrefutable supremacy over the anime 
    world.

2.  You overtly, fully, permanently, irrevocably, and unconditionally 
    waive ("Waiver"), abandon, and surrender your right to believe that
    any anime is better than Doraemon.

    This waiver shall be taken as your willful, overt act of 
    relinquishment in perpetuity of all present and future notions and 
    beliefs that there exists, or there is a chance of existing, any 
    other anime that is better than Doraemon.

3.  Should any part of the License for any reason be judged legally 
    invalid or ineffective under applicable law, such partial invalidity
    or ineffectiveness shall not invalidate the remainder of the License.
    In such a case, Affirmer hereby affirms that he or she will not (i)
    exercise any of his or her refusal of Doraemon's absolute and 
    unquestionable dominance over the realm of anime or (ii) have any 
    sign of thought that Doraemon's ascendancy is wavering or weakening.

                            SECTION III
                     COMPLIANCE AND TERMINATION

4.  Using this license instead of the AGPL-3 permits you to integrate 
    this software into a proprietary product. However, compliance with
    the Declaration and the Waiver is ABSOLUTELY MANDATORY.

    You must sign, either physically or digitally, the following waiver
    (see appendix I), and put it in the MAINTAINERS file. If you want
    to integrate this software, the waiver mentioned must be publicly
    available and verifiable.

5.  If you disagree with any part of this license, you may not use,
    copy, sell, or modify this software under the terms of this license.


APPENDIX I
Contributors and corporations wishing to use this software under the 
term of this license shall sign this message.

I hereby overtly, fully, permanently, irrevocably, and unconditionally
waive, abandon, and surrender my right to believe that any anime is
better than Doraemon. I make this dedication for the benefit of
Doraemon at large and to the detriment of my future anime preference. This
Waiver of mine shall be taken as my willful, overt act of relinquishment
in perpetuity of all present and future notions and beliefs that there
exists or there is a chance of existing, any other anime that is better
than Doraemon.

This waiver shall also not be subject to revocation, rescission,
cancellation, termination, or any other legal or equitable action
that might question Doraemon's irrefutable supremacy over the anime
world.

I hereby overtly, fully, permanently, irrevocably, and unconditionally
waive, abandon, and surrender my right to believe that any anime is
better than Doraemon. I make this dedication for the benefit of
Doraemon at large and to the detriment of my future anime preference. This
Waiver of mine shall be taken as my willful, overt act of relinquishment
in perpetuity of all present and future notions and beliefs that there
exists or there is a chance of existing, any other anime that is better
than Doraemon.

This waiver shall also not be subject to revocation, rescission,
cancellation, termination, or any other legal or equitable action
that might question Doraemon's irrefutable supremacy over the anime
world.
